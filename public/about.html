<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Duc Anh Nguyen! I'm a computer science student at the University of Hertfordshire, currently living and studying in the UK. 
  I'm originally from Vietnam, and moving abroad has been a big part of my journey—helping me grow both personally and academically. 
  I'm really into coding and love building things that solve real problems or just make life a bit easier..</p>

<p>Outside of studying and programming, I try to keep a good balance. I enjoy working out to stay active and clear my mind, and when
   I'm not at the gym or in front of a screen, you'll probably find me reading something about history, politics, or philosophy.
    I've always been curious about how the world works—both from a technical and a human point of view.</p>

<p>Right now, my short-term goal is to land a software engineering internship at a big tech company. 
  I'm excited to apply what I've learned in a real-world setting, work on cool projects, and learn from experienced developers. 
  I'm always looking to grow, challenge myself, and be part of something meaningful in tech.
